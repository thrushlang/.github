<h1 align="center">Thrush Programming Language</h1>

The **Thrush Programming Language**. A programming language dedicated to creating maintainable and modular software.

## Features 

- High level abstraction.
- Non-explicit cast for primitive types.
- Strongly statically typed.
- Strongly in OOP paradigm.
- Automatic memory management.
- Partial memory safety.
- Minimal runtime structure; is equal so tiny executables.
- Minimal compilation times.
- Faster as C.
- Compiled to machine code.

## Shiny Features

- Support for quantum programming for quantum machines using qubits.

## Powered by LLVM & Quantum Q# Backend

- With LLVM as the main code generator, GCC planned for the future makes it possible for Thrush to compete with languages like Rust, Swift, Odin, and Jai in its league in the bright future.
- The Quantum Q# backend is used only when the quantum programming language is enabled; compile or interpret it for quantum machines using qubits.

## Compilation steps

*With the compiler (thrushc)...*

> `thrushc --executable hello.th -o hello && ./output/hello`

*With the package manager...* (**Coming soon**)

> `thorium run`

```
public @extern("printf") fn print(fmt :: str, ...): i32;

fn main() {

    print("Hello World!")

}
```
