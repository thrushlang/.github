**Thrush Programming Language** is strongly statically typed, AOT compiled to machine code, highly optimized, **general-purpose** programming language to build maintainable software.

## Features 

- High level abstraction.
- Non-explicit cast for primitive types.
- Strongly statically typed.
- Strongly in OOP paradigm.
- Automatic memory management.
- Partial memory safety.
- Minimal runtime structure; is equal so tiny executables.
- Faster as C.
- Compiled to machine code.

## Shiny Features

- Support for quantum programming for quantum machines using Q# as a backend compiler.

## Compilation steps

*With the compiler (thrushc)...*

> `thrushc --executable hello.th -o hello && ./output/hello`

*With the package manager...* (**Coming soon**)

> `thorium run`

```
public @extern("printf") fn print(fmt :: str, ...): i32;

fn main() {
