<h1 align="center">Thrush Programming Language</h1>

<p align="center">The <b>Thrush Programming Language</b>. A general-purpose systems programming language that provides a new low-level development approach.</p>

## Characteristics

- Syntactically it is based on Rust.
- Inspired by the low-level capabilities of C.

### Inspiration Name

Its name is Thrush, reminiscent of the **[thrush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrush_(bird))** bird, a relative of the **Turdidae** family.<br>Its pronunciation differs from the bird's name; it's actually **T**.. **Rush**, not Thrush.

#### Why this bird?

The **[thrush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrush_(bird))** bird possesses one of the most complex, coordinated, and wonderful songs in the animal world, standing out in a specific area.

This is an analogy.

Thrush is a very expressive and specific language for low-level programming, excelling in memory control, arithmetic operations, assembly, and much more at a low level. It offers a complex type layer to reduce possible runtime errors.

## Philosophy

Thrush allows software developers to create software with complete low-level control. This approach enhances robustness, optimizes performance, and simplifies code development for diverse, even exotic, architectures, directly addressing limitations found in many current systems programming languages.

## Why Thrush?

Thrush is a very promising tool for bare-metal and embedded system development thanks to its innovative low-level instruction concepts, particularly its integrated Low-Level Instructions (LLI) for fluent IR manipulation using GCC and LLVM intrinsics. This prioritizes learning intermediate code, rather than assembler code, unlocking architecture-specific optimizations and low-level type manipulation. Thrush offers low-level control over systems languages ‚Äã‚Äãlike C, Rust, and C++ due to its manipulation of low-level instructions for optimizations.

### Low Level Control

- Thrush enables integration of low-level instructions along their high-level counterparts, allowing developers to fluidly switch between abstraction levels within the same codebase.

```rust
fn main() u32 {

    local number: u8 = 0;

    // Low-level instruction for direct memory access.
    instr loaded_value: u8 = load u8, number;

    return 0;

}
```

- Thrush enables embedding of linear assembler within the compilation process, offering direct control over architecture-specific code generation.

```rust

asmfn invoke_exit_syscall() void {
    "mov $$60, %rax",
    "mov $$1, %rdi",
    "syscall"
} { 
    "~{rax}~{rdi}"
}

fn main() u32 {
    invoke_exit_syscall();
    return 0;
}
```

- Thrush enables compile-time code execution, allowing developers to perform computations and optimizations directly during compilation with a simple, intuitive syntax.

```rust
fn comptime_sum(a: u8, b: u8) u16 @compiletime {
    // Non-explicit cast is allowed.
    return a + b;
}

fn main() u32 {
    comptime_sum(15, 15);
    return 0;
}
```

## Current Features

- Code Generation Control.
- Robust Static Type Checking.
- C Simplicity.
- C Interoperability.
- Native Assembler Interoperability.

## Future Features

- Automatically generated types for C headers (**CBindgen**).
- Quantum code generation, through QIR and CIR.
- Support for quantum behavior emulation with embedded QCOR, or a bytecode runner.

## Goals

- The Thrush Compiler has the ability to output pre-compiled object files ``.o`` for the architecture as well as assembler and its counterparts without going through the pass manager for optimization.
- The Thrush Compiler is very lightweight ``20``MB, considering that it contains embedded Clang for Linux and Windows, to be used as a wrapper to the closest linker.
- The Thrush compiler can now be used as a linker directly; it contains the LLVM Linker embedded in the executable, so you can invoke it directly without relying on external sources. The compiler can be used as a manual linker for ``Elf``, ``Coff``, ``Mach0``, and ``WASM`` formats.

## State

- The Thrush Compiler ``thrushc``: The Thrush compiler is still under development. Currently, we are focusing on developing its complex low-level instruction layer, optimizations in code generation, and a Clang-like C-style generation around LLVM.
- The Thrush Package Manager ``thorium``: The package manager has already begun development but is not yet complete.

## Documentation

The documentation isn't ready yet, as the language is still in deep development. You can see the speculative syntax at https://github.com/thrushlang/syntax.

## Examples

> [!NOTE]  
> This programming language doesn't rely on Clang or GCC to compile without linking; it simply uses them as a gateway to the closest native linker on the system. This is because creating a driver for a specific linker is a very complex task. Many programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãdidn't even have one decades after their development. And this is the reason for the `-clang`, or `-gcc` flag.
 
> [!NOTE]  
> The ``-start`` and ``-end`` flags delimit the parameters to be passed to the currently active link compiler (e.g., Clang or GCC). This is a way to simplify flag processing and, above all, make it independent of the final link compiler.
> 
> It should be noted that in each distribution of the compiler, it will always include a compiled clang for the architecture for which the compiler was compiled so that in the first compilation it installs in `thrushlang/`. If the `-clang` flag is used and no path is specified, the compiler will use the integrated one it has for linking; the same goes for GCC.

### Compiler

#### Linux

```console
mkdir build && ./thrushc -build-dir="build/" -llvm-backend -clang -opt=mcqueen fibonacci.thrush -start -o fibonacci -end && ./fibonacci
```

#### Windows

```console
mkdir build && .\thrushc.exe -build-dir="build/" -llvm-backend -clang -opt=mcqueen fibonacci.thrush -start -o fibonacci.exe -end && .\fibonacci.exe
```

### Linker

The compiler can currently be used directly as a linker. It includes the LLVM Linker, already embedded in the executable, so it requires no external dependencies beyond a C runtime.

In the future, we plan to create wrappers for other linkers to make the compiler completely independent.
In addition, there will be a driver for each.

The example is on Linux with ``.o`` already precompiled:

```console
mkdir build && ./thrushc -build-dir="build/" -llvm-backend -llinker -llinker-flavor=elf --hash-style=gnu --build-id --eh-frame-hdr -m elf_x86_64 -pie -dynamic-linker /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 -o a.out /usr/bin/../l
ib64/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/15.1.1/../../../../lib64/Scrt1.o /usr/bin/../lib64/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/15.1.1/../../../../lib64/crti.o /usr/bin/../lib64/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/15.1.1/crtbeginS.o -L
/usr/bin/../lib64/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/15.1.1 -L/usr/bin/../lib64/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu15.1.1/../../../../lib64 -L/lib/../lib64 -L/usr/lib/../lib64 -L/lib -L/usr/lib build/emit/obj/program.o -lg
cc --as-needed -lgcc_s --no-as-needed -lc -lgcc --as-needed -lgcc_s --no-as-needed /usr/bin/../lib64/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/15.1.1/crtendS.o /usr/bin/../lib64/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/15.1.1/../../..
/../lib64/crtn.o
```

The result is a valid executable, created without external dependencies in relation to the linker, since no external linker and only the Thrush compiler were used.

### Package Manager

In the future, there will be a package manager that works exactly like Rust **Cargo**. Once it is installed in the system path at the root of the project, wherever the **Project.toml** file is located, it will automate the program's build process.

```console
thorium run
```

### Code Example - Hello World

```rust
// ******************************************************************************************
//
//   Hello World!
//
// ******************************************************************************************

// Thrush Programming Language - File extensions
// 
// - '.üê¶'
// - '.thrush'
//

// External declaration for the C printf function
fn print(fmt: ptr) s32 @public @ignore @extern("printf");

fn main() u32 {

    print("Hello World!" as ptr);         
    return 0;

}
```

### Code Example - Fibonacci

```rust
// ******************************************************************************************
//
//   Fibonacci - O(2^n)
//
// ******************************************************************************************

// Thrush Programming Language - File extensions
// 
// - '.üê¶'
// - '.thrush'
//

// External declaration for the C printf function
fn print(fmt: ptr) s32 @public @ignore @extern("printf");

// Computes the nth Fibonacci number recursively
//
// Parameters:
//   n: The index of the Fibonacci number to compute (unsigned 32-bit integer)
//
// Returns: The nth Fibonacci number (unsigned 32-bit integer)
//
// Attributes:
//   @hot: Marks the function as frequently executed, encouraging aggressive optimizations
//         and placement in a .hot section for better cache locality. Useful for
//         performance-critical code, but may conflict with @minsize.
//   @inline:
//         Maps to LLVM's 'inlinehint', suggesting the compiler inline this function
//         at call sites to reduce call overhead. May increase code size, conflicting
//         with @minsize, and may be limited for deep recursion (e.g., n=25).
//
fn fibonacci(n: u32) u32 @hot @inline {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n;
    }

    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

// Prints the first n Fibonacci numbers
// Parameters:
//   n: The number of Fibonacci numbers to print (unsigned 32-bit integer)
fn printFibonacci(n: u32) void {
    for local mut i: u32 = 0; i < n; ++i; {
        print("%d\n", fibonacci(i));
    }
}

fn main() u32 {
    print("Fibonacci sequence: " as ptr);         
    printFibonacci(25);            

    return 0;
}
```

## Background

In fact, the programming language was originally intended for learning purposes in the compiler field, for the "team" behind the project. However, this doesn't mean it will be __taken as seriously as possible__.

The plan is to offer a full mapping to the entire LLVM-C API and to offer code generation as close to Clang as a C compiler. This also includes future mappings to other backends such as QIR and MLIR, for quantum and more specialized computing, respectively.

The responsible team (practically a *solo developer*) considers it a side, not main, project. We focus on improving both ourselves and our projects in parallel.
